#FunctionConstructor
    A program that can take functions and use equivalence between functions to create new ones. It comes with some Trigonometry functions to test it out. 

##About
    This program was written in Java 7, and is designed to be able to take a function, or a series of functions, and use the relation between them to create new functions.

##How to Use
    The program was written using Netbeans 8.0, so it is easiest to use in an IDE, such as Netbeans or Eclipse (the two that I've heard of)
