#FunctionConstructor
    A program that can take functions and use equivalence between functions to create new ones. 
    It comes with some Trigonometry functions to test it out. 

##About
    This program was written in Java 7, and is designed to be able to take a function, or a
    series of functions, and use the relation between them to create new functions.

##How to Use
    The program was written using Netbeans 8.0, so it is easiest to use in an IDE, such as
    Netbeans or Eclipse (the two that I've heard of). To put into Netbeans, just put it
    with your other projects. It already contains the files that Netbeans created when
    I first created the project, so it's one less thing to do.
